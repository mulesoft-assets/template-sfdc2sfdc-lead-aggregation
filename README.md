# Use Case <a name="usecase"/>
As a Salesforce admin I want to aggregate leads from two Salesforce Instances and compare them to see which leads can only be found in one of the two and which leads are in both instances. 

For practical purposes this Template will generate the result in the format of a CSV Report sent by mail.

This Template should serve as a foundation for extracting data from two systems, aggregating data, comparing values of fields for the objects, and generating a report on the differences. 

As implemented, it gets leads from two instances of Salesforce, compares by the email address of the leads, and generates a CSV file which shows lead in A, lead in B, and leads in A and B. The report is then emailed to a configured group of email addresses.

# Run it! <a name="runit"/>

Simple steps to get SFDC to SFDC Lead Aggregation running 

In any of the ways you would like to run this Anypoint Template, here is an example of the output you'll see after hitting the HTTP endpoint:

<pre>
<h1>Aggregation task completed successfully</h1>
<b>Executed on: </b>Mon Jan 13 18:05:33 GMT-03:00 2014
</pre>

## Running on premise <a name="runonopremise"/>

In this section we detail the way you have to run you Anypoint Temple on you computer.

### Running on Studio <a name="runonstudio"/>
Once you have imported you Anypoint Template into Anypoint Studio you need to follow these steps to run it:

+ Locate the properties file `mule.dev.properties`, in src/main/resources
+ Complete all the properties required as per the examples in the section [Properties to be configured](#propertiestobeconfigured)
+ Once that is done, right click on you Anypoint Template project folder 
+ Hover you mouse over `"Run as"`
+ Click on  `"Mule Application"`


### Running on Mule ESB stand alone <a name="runonmuleesbstandalone"/> 
Complete all properties in one of the property files, for example in [mule.prod.properties] (../blob/master/src/main/resources/mule.prod.properties) and run your app with the corresponding environment variable to use it. To follow the example, this will be `mule.env=prod`.

## Running on CloudHub <a name="runoncloudhub"/>

While [creating your application on CloudHub](http://www.mulesoft.org/documentation/display/current/Hello+World+on+CloudHub) (Or you can do it later as a next step), you need to go to Deployment > Advanced to set all environment variables detailed in **Properties to be configured** as well as the **mule.env**. 

Once your app is all set and started, supposing you choose as domain name `sfdcleadaggregation` to trigger the use case you just need to hit `http://sfdcleadaggregation.cloudhub.io/generatereport` and the report will be sent to the emails configured.

### Deploying your Template on CloudHub <a name="deployingyourtemplateoncloudhub"/>
Mule Studio provides you with really easy way to deploy your Template directly to CloudHub, for the specific steps to do so please check this [link](http://www.mulesoft.org/documentation/display/current/Deploying+Mule+Applications#DeployingMuleApplications-DeploytoCloudHub)


## Running on premise <a name="runonopremise"/>
Complete all properties in one of the property files, for example in [mule.prod.properties] (../blob/master/src/main/resources/mule.prod.properties) and run your app with the corresponding environment variable to use it. To follow the example, this will be `mule.env=prod`.

After this, to trigger the use case you just need to hit the local http endpoint with the port you configured in your file. If this is, for instance, `9090` then you should hit: `http://localhost:9090/generatereport` and this will create a CSV report and send it to the mails set.

## Properties to be configured (With examples)<a name="propertiestobeconfigured"/>

In order to use this Mule Template you need to configure properties (Credentials, configurations, etc.) either in properties file or in CloudHub as Environment Variables. Detail list with examples:

### Application configuration
+ http.port `9090` 

#### SalesForce Connector configuration for company A
+ sfdc.a.username `bob.dylan@orga`
+ sfdc.a.password `DylanPassword123`
+ sfdc.a.securityToken `avsfwCUl7apQs56Xq2AKi3X`
+ sfdc.a.url `https://login.salesforce.com/services/Soap/u/26.0`

#### SalesForce Connector configuration for company B
+ sfdc.b.username `joan.baez@orgb`
+ sfdc.b.password `JoanBaez456`
+ sfdc.b.securityToken `ces56arl7apQs56XTddf34X`
+ sfdc.b.url `https://login.salesforce.com/services/Soap/u/26.0`


#### SMPT Services configuration
+ smtp.host `smtp.gmail.com`
+ smtp.port `587`
+ smtp.user `exampleuser@gmail.com`
+ smtp.password `ExamplePassword456`

#### Mail details
+ mail.from `exampleuser@gmail.com`
+ mail.to `woody.guthrie@gmail.com`
+ mail.subject `SFDC Leads Report`
+ mail.body `Leads report comparing leads from SFDC Accounts`
+ attachment.name `OrderedReport.csv`

# API Calls <a name="apicalls"/>

SalesForce imposes limits on the number of API Calls that can be made. Therefore calculating this amount may be an important factor to consider. Lead Aggregation Template calls to the API can be calculated using the formula:

***1***

The reason for the "formula" to be a constant number is that this Anypoint Template only require one API call to recover the require data.

# Customize It!<a name="customizeit"/>

This brief guide intends to give a high level idea of how this Template is built and how you can change it according to your needs.
As mule applications are based on XML files, this page will be organized by describing all the XML that conform the Template.
Of course more files will be found such as Test Classes and [Mule Application Files](http://www.mulesoft.org/documentation/display/current/Application+Format), but to keep it simple we will focus on the XMLs.

Here is a list of the main XML files you'll find in this application:

* [config.xml](#configxml)
* [endpoints.xml](#endpointsxml)
* [businessLogic.xml](#businesslogicxml)
* [errorHandling.xml](#errorhandlingxml)


## config.xml<a name="configxml"/>
Configuration for Connectors and [Properties Place Holders](http://www.mulesoft.org/documentation/display/current/Configuring+Properties) are set in this file. **Even you can change the configuration here, all parameters that can be modified here are in properties file, and this is the recommended place to do it so.** Of course if you want to do core changes to the logic you will probably need to modify this file.

In the visual editor they can be found on the *Global Element* tab.


## endpoints.xml<a name="endpointsxml"/>
This is the file where you will found the inbound and outbound sides of your integration app.
This Template has an [HTTP Inbound Endpoint](http://www.mulesoft.org/documentation/display/current/HTTP+Endpoint+Reference) as the way to trigger the use case and an [SMTP Transport](http://www.mulesoft.org/documentation/display/current/SMTP+Transport+Reference) as the outbound way to send the report.

###  Trigger Flow
**HTTP Inbound Endpoint** - Start Report Generation
+ `${http.port}` is set as a property to be defined either on a property file or in CloudHub environment variables.
+ The path configured by default is `generatereport` and you are free to change for the one you prefer.
+ The host name for all endpoints in your CloudHub configuration should be defined as `localhost`. CloudHub will then route requests from your application domain URL to the endpoint.


## businessLogic.xml<a name="businesslogicxml"/>
Functional aspect of the Template is implemented on this XML, directed by one flow responsible of conducting the aggregation of data, comparing records and finally formating the output, in this case being a report.
The *mainFlow* organises the job in three different steps and finally invokes the *outboundFlow* that will deliver the report to the corresponding outbound endpoint.
This flow has Exception Strategy that basically consists on invoking the *defaultChoiseExceptionStrategy* defined in *errorHandling.xml* file.


###  Gather Data Flow
Mainly consisting of two calls (Queries) to SalesForce and storing each response on the Invocation Variable named *leadsFromOrgA* or *leadsFromOrgB* accordingly.

###  Aggregation Flow
[Java Transformer](http://www.mulesoft.org/documentation/display/current/Java+Transformer+Reference) responsible for aggregating the results from the two SalesForce Org Leads.
Criteria and format applied:
+ Transformer receives a Mule Message with the two Invocation variables *leadsFromOrgA* and *leadsFromOrgB* to result in List of Maps with keys: **Name**, **Email**, **IDInA** and **IDInB**.
+ Leads will be matched by mail, that is to say, a record in both SFDC organisations with same mail is considered the same lead.

###  Format Output Flow
+ [Java Transformer](http://www.mulesoft.org/documentation/display/current/Java+Transformer+Reference) responsible for sorting the list of leads in the following order:

1. Leads only in Org A
2. Leads only in Org B
3. Leads in both Org A and Org B

All records ordered alphabetically by mail within each category.
If you want to change this order then the *compare* method should be modified.

+ CSV Report [DataMapper](http://www.mulesoft.org/documentation/display/current/Datamapper+User+Guide+and+Reference) transforming the List of Maps in CSV with headers **Name**, **Email**, **IDInA**, and **IDInB**.
+ An [Object to string transformer](http://www.mulesoft.org/documentation/display/current/Transformers) is used to set the payload as an String. 

###  Outbound Flow
**SMTP Outbound Endpoint** - Send Mail
+ Both SMTP Server configuration and the actual mail to be sent are defined in this endpoint.
+ This flow is going to be invoked from the flow that does all the functional work: *mainFlow*, the same that is invoked from the Inbound Flow upon triggering of the HTTP Endpoint.


## errorHandling.xml<a name="errorhandlingxml"/>
Contains a [Catch Exception Strategy](http://www.mulesoft.org/documentation/display/current/Catch+Exception+Strategy) that is only Logging the exception thrown (If so). As you imagine, this is the right place to handle how your integration will react depending on the different exceptions. 

## Testing the Template <a name="testingthetemplate"/>

You will notice that the Template has been shipped with test.
These devidi them self into two categories:

+ Unit Tests
+ Integration Tests

You can run any of them by just doing right click on the class and clicking on run as Junit test.

Do bear in mind that you'll have to tell the test classes which property file to use.
For you convinience we have added a file mule.test.properties located in "src/test/resources".
In the run configurations of the test just make sure to add the following jvm property:

+ -Dmule.env=test
